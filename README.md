# WHY
Newer version of apple macos comes with tons of bloatware which annoying side effects
- The telemetry and tracking stuffs consume resource high cpu / ram usage when you dont even need those
- When was the last time you use siri on macos?
- Other apps like news, maps, address book ... runs background services even when you never open them.
More and more of stuffs like this make this script becoming essential.


# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
- Need to disable sip ("csrutil disable" from Terminal in Recovery) if you want to disable system services. After that you can re-enabl sip.
- There is a reverse script if you encounter undesired effect (like accidentally disable spotlight when you still need it).
